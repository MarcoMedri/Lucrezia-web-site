    <h2 id="shortPresentation" class="aboutSection">Short presentation</h2>
    <p>My name Is Lucrezia, I was born in Italy in 1991, more precizely in Colle Val d'Elsa, a small city in Tuscany,
      really close to the more famouse Siena. There I took the first steps. Like most of the italian
      I did my kindergarten, my elementary, middle and also the superior school there. That allowed me to build really
      strong friendships that nowadays still hold on (despite me &#9786;). After that I felt my town too small for me,
      I was eager to live new experience, discover other places, other reality, so I travelled to Milan in order to
      start
      my university career as <a href="#designerPresentation">Designer</a>!
    </p>
    <p>
      There I lived 5 years unforgettable, I've had a lot of amazing experience. The university was tough and drained
      a lot of energy, but my study mates always cheered me up (or at least the tried).
    </p>
    <p>Graduation done, so next step? Of course, I needed to find a job, so after some research,
      I found my next spot. Cesena!</p>
    <p>There I could conciliate two of my best passions design and <a href="#fitnessPresentation">fitness</a>. I
      started working
      for Technogym, at the beginning has been hard, new environment, new job, I knew noone (yet), but I was too much
      excited. Live there changed my life, I met really valid co-workers, I learned a lot from them someone is still an
      inspiration for me. But most of all I found amazing people, some of them are still my friends and really good
      ones,
      those kind that when you come back, time seems to never went on. I had friends, I had the sea (you still miss me
      &#9785;),
      but I wanted also to try, try new adventures, live different cultures, test myself in tough situations, so I
      decided
      to move for the umpteenth time, so France I'm coming!
    </p>

    <h2 id="designerPresentation" class="aboutSection"> As designer </h2>
    <p>I have always loved when useful things are also beautiful and simple and that the reason that pushed me to
      study design, in order to be able to create new beautiful things. For me design is more related to a point
      of view, I like beautiful stuff in general, natural landscape, small handmade objects, all days environments.
      Everything is a piece of design if viewed in a wider way. I like when stuff are made in the best way, cause when
      it happens, you can
      feel it, you perceive that something is perfect, it is like it was supposed to be. I hope to carry out something
      good in that way in the future, currently I'm still learning, observing and trying.
    </p>
    <p>Like every good designer I really love photography. I'm very luky cause my uncle gifted me a camera and ever
      since
      I'm trying to imrove my skills, unfortunatly time is never too much so my level is always below my expectation,
      but as always I'm positive, I will do also this!
    </p>
    <p style="text-align:left"> <b>P.S.</b> If some one is interested Netflix as a lot of good documentary relative to
      design, I love them.</p>

    <h2 id="fitnessPresentation" class="aboutSection"> As "fit/sport" girl </h2>
    <p>I love practice every kind of sport, I never step back in front of new opportunities.
      I usually prefer team workouts instead of individual ones, I think that share the suffering allow you to go
      further your limits and of course it's good meet new people as well.
      <br>I also love practise out of the gym breathe fresh and clean air is amazing. So I go running expecially,
      even though right now I'm not in my best shape, but in summer I love more beach sports, and of course
      beachvolley is my favourite one (to be honest I have played volleyball for several years, maybe that is
      the reason).
      <br>Beyond the pure power and tonicity of the muscles, I belive that flexibility is essential for an healthy
      life,
      so I started to be passionate about yoga and pilates, moreover after a while I decided to try to become an
      instructor. Therefore I started a very good crush course in Bologna and in the end I obtained my own
      certificate, and now I have the licence to teach it.
      <br>I would like also to do something specific for the yoga part, cause the spiritual part related to this
      discipline is amazing, even though now I don't have the right amount of time to invest in this activicty that is
      all but easy to learn properly. I approached this discipline cause it makes me feel better both from physical and
      spiritual point of view.
    </p>
    <p>
      Last but not least I try to train a lot cause I really love <a href="#chefPresentation">food</a>, so I hope that
      this activity gives me the possibility to eat more and don't became fatter then how I am right now.
      <br> Jokes a part, physical activity allow me to feel better, clear my mind when I am stuck in certain thoughts,
      see myself better and of course puts me in the position to not overthinking whether I may or may not eat
      something,
      so every time I go out I can allow myself a cheat without feel bad.
    </p>

    <h2 id="chefPresentation" class="aboutSection"> As chef (or better big eater)</h2>
    <p>
      To be honest I'm more a good eater than a chef!
      <br>I literally like every kind of food, starting from the starters, passing through the vegetables,
      meat, fish, every king of vegetarian protein and ending with the dessert obviously.
      I love this part of myself, cause I like to make a parallel beetwen my stomach and my mind and if I have
      an open stomach I woul think that I have also an open mind.
      <br>Skipping this philosophical part, I love taste different foods caming from different paths, different kind
      of preparation, different raw mattters, different cultures. As in all the sections of my life I love try,
      explore my limits (maybe insects is the food that I haven't already tried) and discover news. I'have been
      lucky, I knew a lot of people caming from different country, with food cultures really different one 
      to each other, thus I've had the opportunity to taste amazing exquisiteness.
      <br>Before you think that I'm just a gluttonous, I try also to express myself making new dishies, inventing new
      recipes, doing home made pasta and so on. Also now that I finally have a dishwasher, I can avoid the worst part
      of cooking, so I'll be more active.
      <br>I hope I'll be able to show some of mine recipes and several healthy/junk meals.
    </p>

    <img src="../../support/img/about/World_map_-_low_resolution.svg" alt="myPlaces" class="curveRight">
    <h2 class="aboutSection"> As traveller</h2>
    <p>
      Like a lot of people, I really love travel arround the world, both for just few days and for weeks 
      (not so often unfortunatly). See beautiful places, landscape, meet new interesting coltures and amazing
      people expand and feel your soul, makes you a better person, gives you a wider awareness. 
      <br> I'm always uncertain if wanna go abroad or visit all the cities in Italy, go in a big capital or see 
      all the small reality, and it's tough choosing every time, how you make your decisions?
      I already have a list of all my next stops but everytime I talk with my friend a new amazng places cames out 
      and I have to add it to my list, stretching it if it's still possible. 
      Anyway I hope to make a section where I will be able to show my places, what I saw, who I encountered, I would
      like to share my experience as much as possible.
      <br>Of course money and time are the worst enemies for a traveller, but don't give up! There is always a way to 
      do what you really want to do, you just need to find your one.
    </p>

    <h2 id="readerPresentation" class="aboutSection">Reader</h2>
    <p>
      Unfortunatly I am not a good reader as I would like to be. I mean I like reding, but is not so easy find the 
      right time slot to do it. I tried to read and the bus, by optimizing the time, but is not so easy for my sight.
      I recently received as gift an Amazon Kindle and it's a little bit better, but still not the perfect environment.
  <br> Like for all the stuff of my life, I don't really have a category that I prefer most, but in the last period 
  of my life I'm focusing myself on books that concern the personal growth. I read few interesting books and if you 
  good suggestion, don't hesitate to <a href="../contact/index.html">contact </a> me!
