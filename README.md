Hi everyone!

This is my first website project and my first project on GitHub. 
I'm doing it for my girlfriend to help her in her job and most important, to learn new stuff about Html, CSS and JS, thus play in the "free time" :).

I'm open to any suggestion, you're welcome, I need all the possible help!!
